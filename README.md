## 🟢 Beginner Track

The **Beginner Track** introduces participants to core **MLOps fundamentals** with a simple, hands-on deployment flow. You’ll:

* Build a **Streamlit or Gradio UI** around a ready-made ML model
* **Containerize** the app with Docker
* **Deploy** it to Hugging Face Spaces for a live, shareable demo

📌 Get started:
➡️ [Beginner Track Scope of Works](./beginner/README.md)
➡️ [Beginner Report Template](./beginner/REPORT.md)
➡️ [Submit your work](./beginner/submissions/)


## 🔴 Advanced Track

The **Advanced Track** focuses on building a more **production-grade ML service**. You’ll:

* Develop a **FastAPI backend** (with a minimal frontend)
* **Containerize** your application with Docker
* Set up a **basic CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions
* **Deploy** the service to a cloud platform such as Hugging Face Spaces, Render, or AWS/GCP

📌 Get started:
➡️ [Advanced Track Scope of Works](./advanced/README.md)
➡️ [Advanced Report Template](./advanced/REPORT.md)
➡️ [Submit your work](./advanced/submissions/)


## 📊 Dataset / Model

For this project, we’ll provide pre-trained ML model artifacts that already include preprocessing and the trained estimator. This ensures participants can focus on serving, containerization, and deployment rather than model training.

## 🗂️ Project Workflow & Timeline

| Week       | Beginner Track (UI-first)                      | Advanced Track (API-first)                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Week 1** | Setup + Build Streamlit/Gradio UI + Local test | Setup + FastAPI service + Local inference   |
| **Week 2** | Containerize app & deploy to Huggingface spaces| Containerize FastAPI app with Docker        |
| **Week 3** |                      -                         | Deploy and setup CI/CD pipelines            |
